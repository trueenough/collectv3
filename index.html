Look around your home, full of memories and objects reminding you of far off places or people long gone. Your displays of knick knacks, the paintings and photographs that hang on our walls, your furniture, your cups and saucers, all testify to who you are and what you treasure.

<div class="bodycopy"><p>I have been a collector my entire life — literally since the day I was born, as evidenced by the fact that I still have my hospital wristband. It doesn’t have my name on it, just my mother’s. And not even her actual name, but “Mrs. Allan” (my father’s name). But what’s in a name, really.</p>

<p>As a child I was attracted to objects, particularly to objects in sets and systems. I was encouraged by my parents, through the purchase of kits and albums and magnifying glasses, to pursue normal (if nerdy) childhood collections such as coins, stamps and, later, comic books; however, I also maintained several bizarre secret collections. In my bedroom closet, in a small cardboard box with a hinged lid, I hid an extensive collection of condiment packets: various ketchups and mustards from this or that fast food joint, but also rarer finds: maple syrup, pickle relish, duck sauce (whatever that was), each one hermetically sealed in its tiny plastic pouch. </p>
</div>

            <div class="circlemobilewrapper">
              <div class="circlemobile2"></div>
            </div>

<div class="bodycopy"><p>I also collected “Made In” labels, the small stickers found on the bottoms of various collectibles indicating the country of origin. I was fascinated by geography — as my fifth grade classroom’s representative to that year’s school-wide Geography Bee, I survived several rounds before being eliminated for not being able to identify the two rivers that defined Mesopotamia (the Tigris and the Euphrates, for your future reference).  Accompanying my mother to stores such as Ben Franklin and Joy’s Hallmark, I would wander through aisles of porcelain figurines and other miscellany scanning for countries I did not yet have (no use for duplicates). I would peel the small stickers off the bottoms of the objects and, once home, transfer them onto three-by-five index cards, protected by a lamination of Scotch tape. Having spent my entire life within the tri-state area, I like to think I was satisfying my love for geography in a more concrete way, travelling the world vicariously through those labels — Vietnam, Turkey, Canada. To this day, I can picture Sri Lanka: a small black oval with white lettering and white outline along the border. </p>

<p>Stealing stickers off of music boxes and wicker baskets may have been a victimless crime, but I would also shoplift: an Oreo cookie refrigerator magnet from Kmart. A piano-shaped paper clip from Eckroth Music. A single bead from a craft store in one of Bismarck’s long-dead shopping malls. A Dexatrim capsule — not a box, just a single dose. I would carefully separate the two halves of the translucent capsule to free the tiny multi-colored spheres, then seal them inside again with an almost imperceptible <i>click</i> of the two half-ovals. Never anything of value, never anything worth getting caught over (yet I did, twice); these objects formed another, doubly clandestine collection.</p>

<div class="bodycopy"><p>Did I identify as a collector at this young age? I don’t recall ever using the term to describe myself, at least not until adulthood, but in retrospect it seems clear that I was. What does it mean to be a collector? The term itself resists definition (but what’s in a name, really). Cultural theorist Mieke Bal elaborates on the struggle to pin down an origin:</p>
<blockquote>Collecting comes to mean collecting precisely when a series of haphazard purchases or gifts suddenly becomes a meaningful sequence… One object must have been the first to be acquired, but then, when it was first it was not being collected — merely purchased, given or found, and kept because it was especially gratifying. In relation to the plot of collecting, the initial event is arbitrary, contingent, accidental… Only retrospectively, through a narrative manipulation of the sequence of events, can the accidental acquisition of the first object become the beginning of a collection.</blockquote>

            </div>

<div class="bodycopy"><p>Illustrating the paradox, Bal describes a friend with an interest in vases who crossed this mysterious line between purchaser and collector. Bal suggests that self-identity as a collector may be a function of motive — namely, no longer needing one. “Buying a thing or two,” Bal observes, “doesn’t make you a collector, not yet,” because there could be any number of reasons to keep that second piece. Even at vase number six, “you can still argue that you need six different sizes to accommodate the different lengths flowers come in.” But sometime between vase number six and vase number 50, the friend realizes he no longer “need[s] any justification, because one day he happily found himself a collector.”</p> 
 
<p>So what was the fate of my early collections? At some point my mom found the box of condiments and threw them away, and the project was thus abandoned. I held onto a few of the coins, but the rest were sold at a garage sale just a few years ago, boorishly dumped into a plastic tub that had been emptied of its Fancy Mixed Nuts. The “Made In” labels? Abandoned, whereabouts unknown. But certain items I’ve held onto, and I’ve continued to collect; some might say the objects of my adult fascination are no less nonsensical than those of my childhood. I collect decorative objects, but only very particular types: Virgin Mary figurines, globes, creepy Christmas kitsch. I collect travel souvenirs: lapel tabs from museums, “player’s club” cards from casinos, tiny toiletry bottles from hotels. I collect a few types of things that others might consider legitimately collectible: vintage board games, telephones, typewriters, salt-and-pepper shakers — but only the most outlandish, such as a porcelain John F. Kennedy (salt), seated with legs crossed in a (pepper) rocking chair.</p>

<div class="bodycopy"><p>My gathering of oddities may not be destined for posterity, but you would be surprised where some such items can pop up. For example: among my collections of collections, I have about a half-dozen typewriters. Several, like my Olivetti Lettera 22, are objects that can also be found in numerous museum collections, embraced by the canon of design history, touted as the work of avant garde Italian industrial designers (in this case, Marcello Nizzoli) and noted for their contribution to bringing a more humane, more expressive (later bordering on experimental) aesthetic into the workaday office environment. Then, there’s my Smith-Corona Corsair DeLuxe. Both portable, both well-preserved with travel cases intact, and both in not terribly dissimilar shades of teal. On one hand, the Olivetti comes with a design-award-laden and curator-endorsed pedigree; where it came from or whose hands it passed through before I liberated it from a junk shop in Alexandria, Minnesota, are not only unknown but irrelevant. On the other hand, the Smith Corona was the typewriter on which my mother, Marcella Paul, composed her college papers. My mom has never been to MoMA, MoMA has never heard of my mom, and the object is left to personal collectors such as myself or Robert Messenger, proprietor of the self-professed Australian Typewriter Museum (“Before I knew it, three typewriters have turned into 903!”). In this battle of Marcello vs. Marcella, I keep both side-by-side in my basement: a draw.</p>
<p>Perhaps the detritus of our lives gets collected precisely due to its unique combination of powers over us mere mortals. If a typewriter, a teapot, a seashell, or the little plastic tripod that keeps your pizza's cheese from sticking to the pizza box lid can set your mind to wander, can cause your thoughts to stray to childhood, or to Vermillion South Dakota, or to God or Bob Dylan, then there’s little that it cannot do.</p>
